## About

whatsapp‑web.js is a powerful [Node.js][nodejs] library that lets you interact with WhatsApp Web, making it easy to build a dynamic WhatsApp API with nearly all features of the web client. It uses [Puppeteer][puppeteer] to access WhatsApp Web’s internal functions and runs them in a managed browser instance to reduce the risk of being blocked.
