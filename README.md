## About
**A WhatsApp API client that operates via the WhatsApp Web browser.**

The library launches the WhatsApp Web browser app via Puppeteer, accessing its internal functions and creating a managed instance to reduce the risk of being blocked. This gives the API client nearly all WhatsApp Web features for dynamic use in a Node.js application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.**
