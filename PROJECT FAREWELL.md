Hello everyone, it's purpshell.
Just finished my uni exams and got a really good marks, but that's not the point now.

I want to put this out once, publicly, and with enough clarity that it doesn't need to be re-explained every other day in DMs, Discord channels, or speculative threads created by people who were never meaningfully involved to begin with.

whatsapp-web.js is DEAD.

Not paused. Not "quietly maintained". Not waiting for the right moment. Dead. Anyone still framing it as "recoverable" is either lying to themselves or deliberately misleading others. I failed to capture it, failed to impose the level of control and direction required to make it scale, and unlike some people, I'm not interested in role-playing competence while nothing actually moves.

A large part of this if not all of it is on me. My communication style is not for everyone, and I'm not interested in pretending it is. Key contributors, including people like Beny Filho, walked away. Not because the code was impossible, but because dealing with me, my shitty talkings and my desire to turn a free open source project into a tool for making money through the sponsorship. You can call that drama if it helps you sleep. I don't care.

Now I'm opening PRs and issues in bulk. Not because I owe anyone anything, and definitely not to make peace. I'm doing it because arguing with people who don't build shit is a waste of time. Spam in bulk speaks louder than Discord drama.

Note: today or tomorrow I will publish a message in Discord channel of my official leaving the project.
Stay tuned!

To my sponsors: yes, I see the irony. Selling hope, roadmaps, early access, future rewrites — and delivering very little of it here. If you feel like you bought air and empty promises, that's fair. Because I'm selling you a shit. Laughing it off would be easier, but I'd rather be explicit: whatsapp-web.js is not where your support should go anymore.

I also want to be explicit about my values, since silence is often misinterpreted as neutrality. I support Palestine. I oppose occupation, collective punishment, and the casual dehumanization of an entire people. This isn't performative, and it isn't conditional. If that offends you, you're free to disengage, I will not.

And for those who think intimidation works on me, here's a fun historical footnote: I've already gone fucked up into a legal mess with a $1.34 trillion company and didn't fold. So no, random pressure, vague threats, or corporate posturing don't scare me. My message to people like that is simple: fuck around with the wrong person and you'll learn how boring fear becomes when you don't give a shit about being legally threatened. This isn't me trying to sound tough — it's just a reminder that I've already been on the radar of companies large enough to buy entire governments, and I'm still here, still talking, still building. If that's your idea of leverage, you're late to the joke.

And for the end, move to Baileys.
Build on something that isn't rotting in place.
If you want to support real work instead of propping up a corpse, sponsor me at https://github.com/sponsors/purpshell.

Almost forgot, it's my 18th birthday soon. So don't forget to congratulate me with some good stuff, preferable with money (the link above).
